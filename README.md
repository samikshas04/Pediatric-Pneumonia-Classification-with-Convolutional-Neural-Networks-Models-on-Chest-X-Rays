# Pneumonia Detection with CNN

This project focuses on pneumonia detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch. The CNN is trained on a dataset of medical chest X-ray images for accurate and early diagnosis of pneumonia.


## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Implement a CNN for pneumonia detection using medical chest X-ray images.
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Programming Language:** Python.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of medical chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:

1. **Normal:** Chest X-rays from patients without pneumonia.
2. **Pneumonia:** Chest X-rays from patients with pneumonia.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-detection-cnn.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pneumonia-detection-cnn
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

```bash
jupyter notebook pneumonia_detection.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python pneumonia_detection.py
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to train and test the CNN model.

## Results

After training, the CNN demonstrates its ability to accurately classify chest X-ray images, aiding in the early detection of pneumonia. Results and visualizations are presented in the notebook or script.
